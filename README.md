# Magenta Web App
built by Asher Vogel

This web app makes many of Magenta's MusicVAE models, as well as the DrumsRNN, accessible without having to code!

## Usage

This web app is currently only available to run locally. To use it, follow these steps:

1. clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:ashervogel/Magenta-Web-App.git`
2. install dependencies: `npm install`
3. run locally: `npm run dev`

## Future Directions

* the MIDI files that the DrumsRNN page downloads don't work properly - this should be cleaned up
* find samples of bass, snare, kick, and other drums sounds to make the Tone player sound better
